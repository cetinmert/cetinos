This operating system manager is built upon the foundation of the Arch Linux kernel, where regular Arch Linux only facilitates the operation of this management system, and its management functionality is configured using Node.js. Additionally, it is developed using an HTML, CSS, and JS-based architecture (Electron). The goal is to provide users with simplicity, lightness, speed, and a clean interface. Independently from Arch Linux, it offers fundamental features such as login, filing, file management, permissions, writing, and reading, customized with Node.js. This innovative project acts as a form of system administration to create an operating system and, unlike ordinary systems, provides the opportunity to work with the JS, CSS, HTML development environment through Node.js and Electron at its core.
